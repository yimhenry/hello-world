Hello World,

This is all completely new to me, Never really done this kind of tech stuff. Hopefully I will learn alot of things and apply them to future use. At the momment I'm a simply service technician working on cars. Goal is to aim higher and achieve whatever Id like in the future. With the stage and development of technology, its hard to deny that the future entitles more technical applications and programs. Hopefully im not too late to join the space.

Thank you in advance for all the support and help. 
keep typing :)
